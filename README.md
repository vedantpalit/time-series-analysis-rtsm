This is the public repository for our code which consisted of the implementation of an in-depth time series analysis to Amazon's Quarterly Revenues from 2006-2020. Through the project, we have performed various methods of forecasting such as ARIMA, MA, EWMA, Holts, Holts-Winters and Seasonal ARIMA.
